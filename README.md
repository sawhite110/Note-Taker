# Note-Taker

* This Note-Taker app will take in text information into the note area and title sections, and can be saved, as well as deleted.

* I used Express.js to write the code for the back-end to be able to connect to the front-end and send and retrieve date from the database.

## Use Case

* As a small business owner, you want to be able to write and save notes so that you can organize your thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be complete.
